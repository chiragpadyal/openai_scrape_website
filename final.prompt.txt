Prompt:

Example 1: If the current URL is `https://example.com/page/2`, the pagination pattern is `/page/{number}`.
Example 2: If the current URL is `https://example.com/?page=2`, the pagination pattern is `/?page={number}`.

Instructions:
1. Examine the provided data and determine the pagination pattern used by the website for navigating to the next page. The pagination pattern consists of a URL pattern with a placeholder for the page number. For example, if the placeholder is `{number}`, it will be replaced with the actual page number.
2. Identify the next URL that should be followed for pagination. If there is no next page, set the value to "failed".

   - The product URLs may contain the product name specified as the `_value` key in the JSON data (not mandatory).

4. If you cannot find any product URLs, set the value to "failed".
5. The current URL of the page is {{ current_url }} and all href starting with `/` are relative to the current URL.
